# Alation_Article

The code in this repository started off as sample code for migrating articles, queries and API resources from one instance of Alation
to another. We then added some other samples of code. 

## abok
Files related to the "Alation Book of Knowledge". Should be used to see how to create a PDF. The abok_loader is no longer actively maintained.

## django
Code samples using django. Needs to be executed in the Alation shell.

## fennel
Code related to moving physical metadata from an on-site Alation instance to a cloud instance (for example). 
Uses a Postgres RDS database as a vehicle. This is more efficient than maintaining many virtual data sources.
For more details, search for "The Virtual Data Source is Dead" on Community.

## notebook
Notebooks used during previous training sessions. Recordings can be found on the Community site.

## ops
Sample code for "operations", e.g. checking the contents of backup archives.

# sudoku
A quasi SDK. Contains the AlationInstance class, which provides an easy way to call both official and non-official APIs.


The code is provided as-is and needs to be adapted to your own situation. You need to have a user
name and password for each instance (source and target), or source materials in a pickle format (generated by the same code).
